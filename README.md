## Ultimate Coron Experience!

This is our second project for our SEI course at GA. I made a site for a travel agency that specializes in tours around Coron in the Philippines named "Ultimate Coron Experience" that will enable people around the world to know about their services and will enable users to reserve a tour with them on a certain date. An admin can also maintain the tour packages and places they offer. A live demo link can be seen [here](https://ultimatecoronexperience.herokuapp.com/).

### Technologies Used
This site was made by using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails.

### Features
- Unregistered users can view the tour packages and the places (displaying the exact location through google maps). They can also create an account with them.
- Additionally, registered users can create a booking (itinerary) by selecting a date and tour package. Once created, you can't edit the itinerary.
- An admin account can add, edit, delete, and view the tour packages they offer. The admin is also the only one who can edit and delete the users' itineraries.

### Wish List
- Display markers on all the places in the Google maps API when a user views the tour package.
- Create a multipage form for the itinerary page.
- Ability to add a tour package to the itinerary when the user is in the tour package page.
